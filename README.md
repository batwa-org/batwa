# Project batwa

A project to create an expense tracking app which places ease of use, quick
and efficiency as its core priority. With an easy to navigate UI, and a
1
healthy/adaptive pattern of notifications/reminders we wish to create an app
that is relevant, simple and easy to use. The solution would allow a user to
record a transaction in as few taps as possible, without having to read through
text-heavy options and menus. Ideally, recording a transaction should be easy
to do on the go, maybe while you’re waiting on the counter for your change or
are walking away from the counter after having made one - marking a transaction should be a quick and easy process. <br> <br>
The app should study user patterns to give reminders/notifications that remind
a user to make transactions they regularly make in case they forget. The app
would also be a web app, that you can log in to from any PC/phone with a
modern web browser so that it’s accessible across all devices.
